# Shares Portfolio Project

## Purpose

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

     
## MVP
A user should be able to:

view total current value.
view individual and total performance trends.
retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

## Extensions
Change in price to also be shown in different colours depending on the change.
Made it useable on mobile aswell as web.
